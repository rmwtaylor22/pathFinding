Implementations
===================

Pathfinding Implementation
----------------------------


I implemented this data type by utilizing a priority queue and stack to track the positions of where the walker
traversed. I then implemented the checks to make sure that I was not doing anything illegal.

I represented the search node PFNode with the priority queue which helped me find the path with the least amount of
travel difficulty/ cost.


Walker Implementation
-----------------------

For the walker implementation, I threw the path iterable into an iterator. Then I just "walked" through the maze
by using "iterator.next()". This allowed me to go through each space one by one.

Analysis
=============



map      | h   | cost | search
---------|-----|------|--------
maze32_0 |   0 |   252|     91%
maze32_0 |   1 |   252|     82%
maze32_0 |   2 |   252|     75%
maze32_0 | 128 |   252|     71%
maze32_1 |   0 |    56|     89%
maze32_1 |  16 |    56|     50%
usa128   |    0|1.7x10^10|   55%
usa256   |    0|2x10^10|     65%
usa1024  |    0|1.5x10^7|    50%




Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->

As far as I know, there are no bugs or limitation within my code. I ran several edge cases to check this and feel
good about what I have.

I did not complete the walker class, but with not enough time, I took the L.




Reflection
===========

Critical Thinking
-------------------


I consulted an expert, Dr. Denning, to help me understand the concept of a minimum priority queue. I asked good
questions, like "why is the search path going around the outside of the maze when I have the heuristics set? Is there an
additional function I need to implement?"

I checked edge cases by implementing the checks and then feeding the program variables that should throw an error.

Help
-----------

I received conceptual help as well as debugging help from Dr. Denning. He helped me understand the function of the
priority queue and how to link it with the 2D-array.

I also received conceptual from the CSE help desks. They would look at my code after I asked them my specific questions
and would try to point me in the right direction. They also helped me with java syntax.


I struggled a long time with getting my program to recognize the cost value of each path location. It just ran along the
outside of the maze in the most efficient way with the heights ignored.

This assignment helped me learn about reading information between classes better.
